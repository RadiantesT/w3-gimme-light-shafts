# Gimme Light Shafts

The Witcher 3 Next Gen Edition (ver 4.04 and maybe before) has the problem where with the AA settings `Off` or `FXAA` light shafts would not shown even when enabled.
This mod fixes this problem by reloading the world while also keeping the players location and ingame time intact.
## Installation
1. Download and extract the `.zip`.
2. Copy `install\mods\` folder into the game's root directory (for example `<somewhere in your drive>\GOG Games\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt GOTY\`). There should be no conflicts.
3. (optional) This in needed for using keybinds. Open `settings/The Witcher 3/input.settings_addGLS.txt` and copy the line into your game's settings file (`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Witcher 3\input.settings`).

(for Linux users every `\` is a `/` obviously)
## How to Use
1. Start the game and load your save.
2. Once loaded run the fix:
2. a) via console command - run GLS_gimmelightshafts
2. b) via keybind - press the configured key (default is the `End`-key)
3. You did it! Good job! Now enjoy the game!
## Configure the Keybind
- default is the `End`-key
- you configure it by doing **Installation 3.** - copy the lines into `input.settings`
- you can customize it by `IK_End` to the key of your choice
